This SwiftUI app was developed as a **team project** for a client who requested a customizable travel planning application. ‚úàÔ∏èüåç  
The client defined the requirements, but left the implementation details to the team. Together, we collaboratively designed and implemented the app, making use of **git branches** for structured teamwork.  

## Features  

- ‚úÖ Search for and plan flights using the **Google Flight API (SerpAPI)**  
- ‚úÖ Display local weather conditions with the **OpenWeatherMap API**  
- ‚úÖ Use of **MVVM + R architecture** for clean code structure  
- ‚úÖ Support for both **dummy data in Preview** and **real API data in Simulator**  
- ‚úÖ Persistent storage of user data with integrated **databases**  
- ‚úÖ Collaborative development workflow with **Git branching strategy**  
- ‚úÖ Modern UI built with **SwiftUI**  

## Technologies  

- SwiftUI for the user interface  
- MVVM + R Model for architecture  
- OpenWeatherMap API for weather data  
- Google Flight API (via SerpAPI) for flight search  
- Databases for persistent storage  
- Git & GitHub for collaboration and version control  
- Dummy data for testing & live API data in simulator  

## How to Run  

1. Click the green **"Code"** button on this repository and select **"Open with Xcode"** (if available), or download the ZIP and open the project manually.  
2. Alternatively, open the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` file directly in **Xcode**.  
3. Click the **Run** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button in the top toolbar to build and launch the app in the iOS Simulator or on a physical device.  
4. Use the app to plan trips, search flights, and check the weather at your destinations.
